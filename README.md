## Local Development Setup

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3. Install application dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Set up the PostgreSQL connection in the `.env` file by updating the `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` values according to your PostgreSQL configuration.

5. Generate the application key:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. Create a PostgreSQL database named `inovanti_api`:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE inovanti_api;
    ```

7. Run migrations and seed the database:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

8. Start the Laravel development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

9. Verify that the application is running by accessing the following route in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```
    This will return the system version and other application details.

10. Feel free to run tests by running:
    ```
    php artisan test --parallel
    ```
